# React CRUD Notes

## What are `resources`?

Resources typically refer to the data or information that the application is managing. In the context of a CRUD application, there are typically four basic operations that can be performed on these resources: Create, Read, Update, and Delete.

When we create an app that is built on React.js we need to create components and functions that will allow our users to perform these operations on the resources we provided them with.

Overall, resources is the data we are managing and allowing our users to interact with. By understanding both sides of the equation, we can create a better user experience and create a more intuitive application.

- CRUD are actions that we can apply to resources.
